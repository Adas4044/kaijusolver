# Multi-Floor Building Feature - Summary

## ✅ Feature Implementation Complete

I've successfully added the multi-floor building feature to the Cat Kaiju Game Simulator!

## What's New

### New Building Types

**Two-Floor Buildings:**
- **`B2`** - Low-value 2-floor building (250 points per floor, 500 total)
- **`BU2`** - High-value 2-floor building (500 points per floor, 1000 total)

**Existing Single-Floor Buildings:**
- **`B`** - Low-value 1-floor building (250 points)
- **`BU`** - High-value 1-floor building (500 points)

### How It Works

1. **Two-floor buildings start with 2 floors**
   - When a cat enters the building, it destroys one floor
   - The cat gains points based on the building's value (250 or 500)
   - The building now has 1 floor remaining

2. **Second floor destruction**
   - When another cat (or the same cat) enters the building again, it destroys the second floor
   - The cat gains the same points again
   - The building now has 0 floors and is fully destroyed

3. **Value consistency**
   - Both floors of a 2-floor building have the same value
   - `B2`: Both floors are worth 250 points (low value)
   - `BU2`: Both floors are worth 500 points (high value)

### Visual Display

Buildings now show their type and remaining floors:
- `N2` = Normal-value building with 2 floors
- `N1` = Normal-value building with 1 floor
- `H2` = High-value building with 2 floors
- `H1` = High-value building with 1 floor

## Example Simulation

```
INITIAL STATE:
r N2 . . UI_R    (Red cat at start, B2 building with 2 floors)
g . N2 . UI_G    (Green cat, B2 building)
b . . H2 UI_B    (Blue cat, BU2 building)

TURN 1 - Red hits first floor of B2:
. r . . UI_R     (Red gains +250, building has 1 floor left)
```

After the first hit, the B2 building changes from `N2` → `N1` showing it has 1 floor remaining.

## Files Modified

1. **`simulator.py`** - Added `B2` and `BU2` to TILE_MAP
2. **`README.md`** - Updated documentation with new building codes
3. **`FLOORS_FEATURE.md`** - Comprehensive feature documentation
4. **`test_multifloor.py`** - Test suite demonstrating the feature

## Files Created

- `test_floors.txt` - Test layout with multi-floor buildings
- `multifloor_demo.txt` - Demo layout
- `demo_multifloor.txt` - Simple demo
- `test_multifloor.py` - Unit tests for the feature
- `FLOORS_FEATURE.md` - Detailed documentation

## Testing

All tests pass ✅:
- Original test suite: 4/4 tests passing
- Multi-floor tests: 3/3 tests passing

Run tests with:
```bash
python3 -m unittest test_simulator.py -v
python3 test_multifloor.py
```

## Strategic Impact

Two-floor buildings add new strategy considerations:
- **Higher total value**: A BU2 is worth 1000 points total (vs 500 for BU)
- **Requires multiple hits**: Need to plan for cats to hit the same building twice
- **Path optimization**: May want to route multiple cats through high-value 2-floor buildings
- **Command placement**: Commands can still be placed on partially destroyed buildings

## Example Usage

Create a layout with multi-floor buildings:
```python
[
    ["C_R_S", "B2", "BU2", "C_R_E"],
    ["C_G_S", "B", "BU", "C_G_E"]
]
```

Run the simulator:
```bash
python3 simulator.py your_layout.txt
```

The simulator output will show buildings losing floors as cats destroy them!
